Suppose $fg$ is monic, that is for every $i$ and $j$, $fgi = fgj$ implies $i = j$. Then for any $i$ and $j$ such that $gi = gj$, we also have $fgi = fgj$, which implies $i = g$. So $g$ is monic.

Suppose $fg$ is epic, that is for every $i$ and $j$, $ifg = jfg$ implies $i = j$. Then for any $i$ and $j$ such that $if = jf$, we also have $ifg = jfg$, which implies $i = g$. So $f$ is epic.
